# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

Welcome to the repo for my website, Horiseon, which details some of the products my company has to offer. The three main products are Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. Each of the sections on the website have a picture associated with them to give better orientation. On the right-hand-side of the website details how you can benefit from the products, in the form of Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management.

Thanks for visiting!

## Usage

The website is a one-pager, with all the information ready loaded when the webpage is opened. The navigation bar at the top of the page will help you move around on the page, though this area is yet to be coded as we haven't learned this area of html yet. Feel free to read around!
